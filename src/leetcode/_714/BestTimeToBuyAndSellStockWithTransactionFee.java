 *
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
